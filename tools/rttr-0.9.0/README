set CMAKE_ROOT = <Your path to cmake directory> - REQUIRED

set DOXYGEN_ROOT = <Your path to cmake directory> - OPTIONAL otherwise no documentation will be generated

Start CMake:
e.g.
cmake -G "Visual Studio 11" <Absolute Path to RTTR source code directory>
or with make files:
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -G "NMake Makefiles" <Absolute Path to RTTR source code directory>
// compile with
nmake install
